The sun is shining brightly today.  
A gentle breeze is blowing through the trees.  
Children are playing happily in the park.  
Birds are flying high in the clear sky.  
The flowers smell fresh and sweet.  
People are walking their dogs on the path.  
A butterfly lands quietly on a leaf.  
The clouds move slowly across the sky.  
Everyone seems to enjoy the warm weather.  
Its a perfect day to be outside.
